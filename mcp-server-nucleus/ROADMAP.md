# Nucleus Roadmap

**Last Updated:** April 2026
**Current Version:** 1.8.8

---

## Vision

Nucleus is the **Sovereign Agent Operating System** — the governance, memory, and orchestration layer that makes autonomous AI agents safe, auditable, and controllable. In a world where agent frameworks ship fast and break trust, Nucleus is the governed alternative.
