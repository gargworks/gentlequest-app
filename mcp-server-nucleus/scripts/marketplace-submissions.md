### Full Description (2-3 paragraphs)

AI agents hallucinate, break code, and repeat mistakes. Nucleus catches this. It is an open-source MCP server that brings persistent memory, execution verification, governance, and compliance to any AI agent. Every AI output is verified, every correction is recorded, and every mistake trains the system to not repeat it. Locally, on your machine.

The core loop is called Three Frontiers: GROUND verifies execution across 5 tiers (syntax, imports, tests, runtime). ALIGN captures human corrections as structured verdicts. COMPOUND turns the delta between intent and reality into training signal. The result is a reliability flywheel that improves every session. 114 MCP tools across 14 facades cover memory (engrams), sessions, tasks, orchestration, compliance (EU DORA, MAS TRM, SOC2), and a full CLI.

Nucleus is local-first with zero mandatory cloud dependencies. Install with one command (`uvx nucleus-mcp`, `npx nucleus-mcp`, or `pip install nucleus-mcp`), add to any MCP-compatible IDE (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code), and your agent gains persistent memory and governance that survives across sessions.

## Install Commands

### One-line per IDE

```
Claude Code:    claude mcp add nucleus -- uvx nucleus-mcp
Cursor:         cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=nucleus&config=eyJuYW1lIjoibnVjbGV1cyIsInR5cGUiOiJjb21tYW5kIiwiY29tbWFuZCI6Im5weCIsImFyZ3MiOlsiLXkiLCJudWNsZXVzLW1jcCJdfQ==

Any IDE:        pip install nucleus-mcp && nucleus init
```

### Runtime install commands

```bash
# uvx (Python — zero install, recommended)
uvx nucleus-mcp

# npx (Node — zero install)
npx -y nucleus-mcp

## Blockers, Unknowns & Manual Checks

> Things that need attention, are stuck, or can't be verified from CLI. Check these periodically.

### BLOCKED (needs action to unblock)

| Channel | Blocker | What to do |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers** (84K stars) | Requires Glama AAA score. All 3 PRs (#1887, #4102, #4104) auto-closed. | Fix TDQS (tool descriptions) → publish to PyPI → redeploy Glama Docker → wait for re-score → re-submit PR |
| **Glama Quality Score** | Tool TDQS scores are C (2.0-2.8/5.0) due to generic inputSchema. glama.json still showing "missing or invalid" as of 2026-04-04. | TDQS fix written in stdio_server.py (enum actions, rich descriptions). Needs PyPI publish + Glama redeploy. glama.json is in public repo — may need Glama re-scan time. |
| **Smithery description** | CLI v4+ broken for Python stdio servers — can't republish to update stale description ("Agent control plane..."). | Wait for Smithery CLI fix, or contact Smithery support. Low priority. |
| **Claude Desktop .mcpb** | Built but not uploaded to GitHub release. | Upload dist/nucleus.mcpb as asset on next `gh release create`. |

### UNSURE / NEEDS MANUAL CHECK IN BROWSER

| Channel | Why unsure | How to check |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **PulseMCP** | Cloudflare blocks CLI. Was listed before but curl finds nothing now. | Open https://pulsemcp.com in browser, search "nucleus". If not listed, submit via form or email hello@pulsemcp.com. |
| **MCP.so** | Comment on chatmcp/mcpso#1 didn't trigger indexing. Search returns nothing. | Open https://mcp.so in browser, search "nucleus". May need re-submission. |
| **MCP.Directory** | Submitted 2026-04-04 with 24hr review. Not listed yet. | Check https://mcp.directory after 24hrs. If still missing, resubmit. |
| **FindMCPServers** | Submitted 2026-04-04. Not listed yet. | Check https://findmcpservers.com after a few days. |
| **mcpserver.dev** | Submitted 2026-04-04. Not listed yet. | Check https://mcpserver.dev after a few days. |
| **mcpserverhub.com** | Submitted 2026-04-04 via Tally.so. Not listed yet. | Check https://mcpserverhub.com after a few days. |
| **Cursor Directory** | Listed (confirmed in browser) but curl can't find it (SPA). Description was stale, updated 2026-04-04. | Open https://cursor.directory, search "Nucleus MCP" to verify update took effect. |
| **MCPMarket** | Listed (confirmed in browser) but returns 403 to curl. Can't verify auto-update. | Open https://mcpmarket.com, search "Nucleus" to verify description is current. |

### STALE DESCRIPTIONS (needs update after messaging changes)

| Channel | Current description | Should be |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Glama** | "unified memory layer that synchronizes context..." (old) | Should refresh from updated README on next scan |
| **Smithery** | "Agent control plane that runs on your computer." | Can't update — CLI broken for Python servers |
| **Cursor Directory** | Updated 2026-04-04 | Verify update took effect in browser |

## Release Checklist (what to update per version)

### Always (automated or one-command)
1. `pip install` + `twine upload` → PyPI auto-updates

2. **Homebrew** — Update formula in eidetic-works/homebrew-nucleus
3. **Cursor Directory** — Edit plugin page if description changed
4. **Awesome lists** — Only if merged PRs need version bump (usually not)

## Submission Copy

### Short (under 280 chars)
Nucleus MCP -- open-source MCP server with 114 tools for persistent memory, execution verification, and compliance. Local-first. Works with Claude, Cursor, VS Code. One command: uvx nucleus-mcp https://github.com/eidetic-works/nucleus-mcp

### Forum intro (1 paragraph)
Nucleus is an open-source MCP server that makes AI agents more reliable over time. It provides 114 tools for persistent memory (engrams), 5-tier execution verification (GROUND), human correction capture (ALIGN), and automatic training signal generation (COMPOUND). It includes compliance configs for EU DORA, Singapore MAS TRM, and SOC2. Everything runs locally with zero cloud dependencies. Install with `uvx nucleus-mcp` and add to Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible IDE.

### Tags
Primary: `mcp`, `model-context-protocol`, `ai-agents`, `ai-tools`
Secondary: `memory`, `governance`, `compliance`, `orchestration`, `local-first`

### Competitive positioning
- Alternative to: Context7, MemoryMesh, basic MCP memory servers
- Differentiators: execution verification (GROUND), compliance frameworks, 114 tools (not just memory), training signal generation, full CLI
- Not competing with: LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen (agent frameworks; Nucleus is agent infrastructure)
