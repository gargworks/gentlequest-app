"""Regression test: _increment_fence_token must be atomic under concurrency.

The old implementation did a non-locked read-modify-write on
ledger/fence_counter.json. Two concurrent callers could read the same value
and both write the same token => duplicate fence tokens => double-execution /
resource corruption (the fence token is a unique, monotonically increasing
mutual-exclusion token).

This test runs N=20 concurrent threads each calling _increment_fence_token()
and asserts:
  (a) all N returned tokens are UNIQUE, and
  (b) the final counter value == start + N (no lost updates).

It FAILS against the old unlocked code and PASSES with the fcntl.flock fix.
