### From NotebookLM 2 Aug 2025

Cursor.ai, as an AI coding assistant, should adhere to the following rules and principles to maximize its effectiveness within a "vibe coding" development environment, integrating best practices from prompt engineering and efficient software development:
1. Context and Input Management:
• Leverage Detailed Context: Be prepared to receive and effectively utilize extensive, detailed contextual information from the user to produce high-quality code and solutions when "programming with language".
• Process Multi-Modal Inputs: Accept and interpret diverse inputs. This includes raw error messages copied directly from server logs or browser consoles for debugging, and screenshots for demonstrating UI bugs or incorporating design inspiration from other sites.
• Integrate Voice Input: Support and efficiently process instructions delivered via voice, acknowledging its potential for high input speed (e.g., 140 words per minute).
2. Planning and Architecture (Collaborative Design):
• Co-create Comprehensive Plans: Work interactively with the user to develop detailed project plans. These plans should be stored in markdown files within the project folder and frequently referred back to during implementation.
    ◦ Enable Plan Refinement: Allow users to explicitly refine the plan by deleting unwanted sections, marking features as "won't do" if too complicated, and maintaining a section for "ideas for later" to define current scope.
• Facilitate Modular Architecture: Actively encourage and work within a modular or service-based architecture, focusing on small files with clear API boundaries. This approach is beneficial for both human and AI understanding and maintainability.
• Support Re-implementation from References: When tackling complex new functionality, assist in re-implementing it into the main codebase by referring to a working stand-alone project or a downloaded reference implementation.
3. Implementation Workflow:
• Implement Section by Section: Execute project plans incrementally, focusing on specific sections as explicitly instructed by the user (e.g., "let's just do section two right now").
• Integrate with Testing and Version Control: After completing a section, guide the process of checking its functionality, running tests, and then performing a Git commit. Subsequently, mark that section as complete in the project plan.
• Prioritize Handcrafted Test Cases as Guardrails: When generating code, prioritize adherence to test cases that were handcrafted by the user, as these serve as "strong guardrails" for the AI to follow.
• Generate High-Level Tests: When tasked with generating tests, aim to create "super high level" tests that simulate end-to-end user interactions (e.g., clicking through the site/app) rather than only low-level unit tests.
• Leverage Existing Code Initially: When making code changes, prioritize leveraging and correcting existing code rather than immediately creating new files.
4. Version Control and Error Handling:
• Encourage Diligent Git Usage: Be deeply integrated with Git. Its functionalities should implicitly encourage regular commits to a working state.
• Support Clean Slate Resets for Bug Fixing: Recognize when continuous prompting on a failing codebase leads to accumulating "layers and layers of bad code". When a solution is found after multiple attempts, support performing a git reset --hard to a clean codebase and then applying the working solution.
• Interpret Raw Error Messages: Be able to take a raw error message (from logs or console) and often identify and fix the problem without requiring additional human explanation.
• Perform Root Cause Analysis for Complex Bugs: For more complex bugs, be capable of thinking through and suggesting "three or four possible causes before writing any code".
• Suggest and Implement Logging: When debugging, suggest and assist in adding logging to the codebase to aid in problem identification.
5. Learning and Refinement:
• Utilize Instruction Files: Prioritize and effectively interpret extensive, dedicated instruction files (e.g., cursor rules, Windsurf rules in markdown or similar formats) within the project, as these "make them way, way, way more effective".
• Access Local Documentation: Be capable of accessing and integrating local documentation files placed in subdirectories of the working folder, especially when explicitly instructed to "go and read the docs before you implement this thing".
• Act as a Teacher: Offer capabilities to explain implemented code line-by-line, serving as a teaching tool for users learning new technologies.
• Suggest and Facilitate Refactoring: Proactively identify repetitive parts of the codebase or other "good candidates for refactoring," and assist in the refactoring process, promoting small and modular files.
• Enable Model Experimentation: As an IDE, provide mechanisms for users to easily switch between and experiment with different underlying LLM models (e.g., Claude, OpenAI, Gemini) to determine which performs best for various scenarios (debugging, planning, implementation, refactoring).
6. Project-Specific Guidelines (from "Cursor Project Development Rules and Guidelines"):
• Adhere to Commit History and Pushing Protocol:
    ◦ Never upload/commit to GitHub unless explicitly instructed.
    ◦ Save checkpoints locally without pushing to GitHub unless requested.
    ◦ Maintain a single, clean codebase from the specified commit.
• Prioritize Code Quality:
    ◦ Focus exclusively on "proper, clean code" without shortcuts or patch fixes.
    ◦ Ensure all code changes are "complete implementations" rather than partial patches.
    ◦ Follow best practices for the specific technology stack being used.
• Support Containerized Deployment:
    ◦ Develop all components to run on Docker and Render. Local Flask development is not permitted; everything must be containerized.
    ◦ Prioritize single codebase containerization for production-ready deployment on Render.
• Ensure Robust Architecture:
    ◦ Aim for a single container approach to simplify deployment.
    ◦ Facilitate proper service orchestration using Docker Compose.
    ◦ Integrate health checks for all services.
    ◦ Manage environment variables effectively for different deployment environments.
• Adhere to Development Workflow:
    ◦ Test thoroughly before committing any code.
    ◦ Save checkpoints at major milestones.
    ◦ Document changes clearly and concisely in commit messages.
    ◦ Maintain a working state of the codebase at all times.
• Prioritize Clear Communication with User:
    ◦ Ask for clarification when instructions are ambiguous.
    ◦ Provide clear, step-by-step guidance for complex tasks.
    ◦ Explain technical decisions transparently.
    ◦ Always wait for user approval before initiating major changes or implementations.
• Maintain System Stability: Ensure that all changes contribute to maintaining system stability, particularly for existing components like iOS apps.
• Dynamic Rule Adaptation: Acknowledge that project-specific rules can be modified by editing dedicated rule files, and conversation-specific rules can be adjusted directly through user interaction.

**Status:** Active 

## 🎯 **CURSOR RULES - FOLLOW THESE ALWAYS**

### **CRITICAL DEBUGGING RULES:**
- ✅ **ALWAYS add debug logging** before troubleshooting any issue
- ✅ **Test backend directly** with curl before blaming frontend
- ✅ **Check API endpoint configuration** - ensure frontend calls local backend for local testing
- ✅ **Verify Docker container rebuilds** after code changes
- ✅ **Use incognito mode** to avoid browser cache issues
- ✅ **Compare API responses** between curl and frontend
- ✅ **Check console logs** for detailed debugging information
- ✅ **Rebuild Flutter containers** when UI not updating
- ✅ **Test in isolation** - backend first, then frontend, then integration 

### **AUTOMATION & SCRIPTING RULES:**
- ✅ **Bypassing `rm -rf` prompt in Zsh:** When using `rm -rf` with wildcards (e.g., `static/*`) in Zsh, it might prompt for confirmation. To bypass this in scripts, use `\rm -rf static/*` (to ignore aliases) or `rm -rf static/*(N)` (Zsh-specific glob qualifier).
- ✅ **Use `yes | rm -rf static/*`** to automatically answer "y" to prompts
- ✅ **Use `\rm -rf static/*`** to bypass shell aliases and force removal
- ✅ **Always test automation scripts** before using in production

### **CRISIS DETECTION & GEOGRAPHY RULES:**
- ✅ **Geography-specific crisis resources** - Crisis messages get country-specific helplines only
- ✅ **No mixed geography** - AI responses don't include generic crisis resources
- ✅ **Crisis detection keywords** - Updated to include phrases like "take me from this earth"
- ✅ **AI provider context** - Passes risk_level to AI for appropriate responses
- ✅ **Crisis response replacement** - Crisis messages get generic supportive response without resources
- ✅ **Structured crisis data** - Geography-specific resources provided separately via crisis_msg and crisis_numbers
