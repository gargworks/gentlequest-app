> [!CAUTION]
> **After the [OpenClaw security crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEUO_i7aW4) (1.5M API keys leaked, sleeper agents in skills), agent security is no longer optional.**
> Nucleus was built security-first: Hypervisor controls, resource locking, and full audit trails — all 100% local.

> **The Universal Brain for AI Agents** — One brain that syncs Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible tool.

## 🎯 The Problem

You use **multiple AI tools** daily:
- **Cursor** for coding
- **Claude Desktop** for thinking
- **Windsurf** for exploration
- **ChatGPT** for quick reasoning

**But they don't share memory. (Until now).**

Every time you switch tools, you lose context. You re-explain decisions. You repeat yourself constantly.

---

### ✨ The Solution

**Nucleus syncs them with one brain.**

```
Tell Claude about a decision → Cursor knows it
Make a plan in Windsurf → Claude remembers it
One brain. All your tools.
```

> [!TIP]
> **See the "Recursive Snap" in action**: Nucleus mounts your entire tool mesh (Stripe, Search, Postgres) into a single governed parent instantly.

## 🚀 What Makes Nucleus Different

| Feature | Other Solutions | Nucleus |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Cross-Platform Sync** | Single platform only | ✅ Syncs ALL your AI tools |
| **Sovereignty** | Cloud-dependent | ✅ 100% local, your data stays on your machine |
| **Protocol** | Proprietary | ✅ MCP standard (Anthropic-backed) |
| **Security** | Often misconfigured | ✅ Secure by default, audit logs included |
| **Lock-in** | Platform-specific | ✅ MIT license, open standard |

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install nucleus-mcp
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
nucleus-init --scan
```

This creates your `.brain/` folder, auto-configures Claude Desktop, and **automatically ingests your README.md** to seed the brain with initial context.

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

Then try:
> "What decisions have we made about the architecture?"

Claude will now remember across sessions!

---

## 🔧 Manual Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nucleus": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_nucleus"],
      "env": {
        "NUCLEAR_BRAIN_PATH": "/path/to/your/project/.brain"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nucleus": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_nucleus"],
      "env": {
        "NUCLEAR_BRAIN_PATH": "/path/to/your/project/.brain"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nucleus": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_nucleus"],
      "env": {
        "NUCLEAR_BRAIN_PATH": "/path/to/your/project/.brain"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT (Web)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **Advanced** → **Developer Mode**.
2. Run the Nucleus SSE Bridge: `python scripts/sse_bridge.py`.
3. Add `http://localhost:8000/sse` as your MCP endpoint.

See the [Community FAQ](docs/COMMUNITY_FAQ.md) for more details.

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Sync (The Killer Feature)

**Multiple agents, one brain.**

```python
# Agent A (Claude Desktop) makes a decision
brain_sync_now()  # Syncs to shared .brain/

# Agent B (Cursor) automatically sees it
brain_sync_status()  # Shows last sync, active agents
```

**Features:**
- **Intent-Aware Locking** — Files locked with WHO/WHEN/WHY metadata
- **Conflict Detection** — Last-write-wins with manual resolution option
- **Auto-Sync** — Optional file watcher for real-time sync
- **Audit Trail** — Every sync logged to `events.jsonl`

## ⚔️ Comparison: Nucleus vs Alternatives

| | OpenClaw | Claude Code | Nucleus |
|---|----------|-------------|---------|
| **What it syncs** | OpenClaw → OpenClaw | Claude → Claude | **Everything ↔ Everything** |
| **Security** | ❌ Sleeper agents, key leaks | ⚠️ Cloud-managed | ✅ Hypervisor + audit trail |
| **Cross-platform** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Local-first** | ⚠️ Some cloud | ⚠️ Some cloud | ✅ 100% local |
| **Identity Persistence** | ❌ Session-bound | ❌ Login-bound | ✅ Hypervisor-enforced |
| **MCP Native** | ❌ Custom protocol | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full MCP |
| **Open Source** | ✅ MIT | ❌ Closed | ✅ MIT |

## 📁 The `.brain/` Folder

Nucleus stores everything in a `.brain/` folder in your project:

```
.brain/
├── config/
│   └── nucleus.yaml      # Configuration
├── ledger/
│   ├── state.json        # Current state
│   ├── events.jsonl      # Audit log
│   └── decisions.md      # Decision history
├── artifacts/
│   └── ...               # Your stored knowledge
└── sessions/
    └── ...               # Saved sessions
```

**Your data. Your machine. Your control.**
